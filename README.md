# Mental health and rheumathoid arthritis throw dietary habits
Inspired by the thought-provoking documentary "Super Size Me," this report delves
into an extensive data analysis focusing on patients with arthritis.
Like Morgan Spurlock’s experiment, where he consumed a diet exclusively from
McDonald’s for an entire month, my study aims to explore the intricate relationship
between arthritis, food habits, and depression levels among patients.
With Spurlock’s journey as a cautionary tale, I investigate the potential effects of
dietary choices on health outcomes, drawing valuable insights from a dataset encompassing patients with measured indicators of arthritis, food habits, and depression.
By examining these factors, we seek to shed light on the multifaceted nature of
arthritis and its associated health consequences, aiming to contribute to public health
interventions and strategies.
Furthermore, this analysis prompts us to critically examine broader societal factors
that contribute to the soaring obesity rates in the United States, such as food accessibility, advertising influence, and their impact on individuals’ well-being, particularly in
the context of public health and young populations.
The dataset [Minamino et al., 2021] was collected through a self-reported questionnaire in addition to the KURAMA dataset.
